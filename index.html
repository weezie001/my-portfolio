        <h2>About "Fallen Defiance"</h2>
        <p>
            "Fallen Defiance" tells the story of a ruthless ruler, the Khan, whose grip on power is absolute. His word is law, and disobedience is met with swift and merciless punishment. In the vast and barren lands under his rule, whispers of rebellion arose, carried by the wind like a dying ember in the storm. The painting captures the moment after justice—twisted by tyranny—has been served.

        <p>
            In the foreground, a lone warrior stands, his body weighed down by defeat, his spirit crushed by the overwhelming force of authority. Shadows of the fallen loom behind him, their souls lingering as a grim reminder of what happens to those who dare to stand against power. The quote on the canvas, spoken by Kublai Khan, reinforces the chilling reality: those who suffer are not innocent but are merely receiving divine retribution.

        <p>
            "Fallen Defiance" is more than an artwork; it is a message—a portrayal of the burden that rulers bear and the price of challenging authority. It forces the viewer to question: Is power a curse or a gift? Can justice exist in the hands of one man, or is it merely another weapon in his arsenal?
